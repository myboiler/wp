# Solar Thermal

A solar thermal system, also know as Solar ST, is the type of system that generates heated water from the sun as similar to the now common Solar Photovoltaics (Solar PV) which generates electricity.

Commonly there are two types of Solar Thermal system panels, flat panels or evacuated tubes. There is also a third type that combines Solar PV with Solar ST, this will be discussed in a seperate article.
